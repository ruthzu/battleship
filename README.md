## 🎮 Game Overview

**Battleship** is a two-player strategy game where each player hides ships on a grid and takes turns firing shots to locate and destroy the opponent’s fleet.

### 🧩 Core Features

  Handles user and AI attacks, marking hits and misses visually.
- **Game Logic Control:**

- **Interactive UI:**
  Hover effects and animations for placing and attacking ships.
- **Modular Codebase:**
  Organized with pure functions for ship, board, and player logic.

## ⚙️ How the Game Works

1. **Gameboard Initialization**
   Each player has a 10×10 grid represented as a two-dimensional array.
2. **Ship Placement**

   - Ships are created from a **Ship Factory** function with properties like length and hit count.
   - Ships are placed on valid coordinates with horizontal or vertical orientation.

3. **Attacks**

   - The player selects a square on the enemy board.
   - The board checks if a ship occupies that position and updates the state to **hit** or **miss**.

4. **Computer Moves**

   - The computer makes random (or strategic) attacks on untried coordinates.

5. **Win Condition**

   - When all ships in one fleet are sunk, the game ends and the winner is announced.
